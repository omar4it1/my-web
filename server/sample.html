        After almost a week of regular demonstrations, protests in Morocco turned violent, resulting in hundreds injured and two deaths. Who's behind the protests, what are they demanding, and where might this end?

            Since last week, the streets of the Moroccan capital Rabat have been unusually quiet. This is because in the early evening, the city center turns into an arena for demonstrations led by an anonymous collective known as GenZ 212.

        The name Gen Z indicates the age of the protesters, who are mostly in their teens or twenties, and the numbers 212 are Morocco's dialing prefix.

        The protests started small on September 27, but gradually grew to include working-class neighborhoods throughout Rabat. It then spread to Morocco's biggest cities, including Casablanca and Agadir, and then to smaller towns, too.

        Recently, they have become violent. Morocco's Interior Ministry reported that as a result of violence earlier this week, over 400 people had been arrested, 263 security officers injured, and 142 of their vehicles damaged. A further 20 privately-owned cars were also damaged and 23 civilians injured, the ministry said.

        Two people were killed on October 1, after police fired at protesters in the southern town of Lqliaa, reportedly in self-defense, Morocco's state news agency reported.
